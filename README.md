## My process
While undertaking the project i followed a simple process which eased the challenge:
	a) Created a folder and initialized it with git and created the files needed for the challenge.
	a) Structured my content with HTML.
	b) Wrote out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`. 
	c) Added css styles from the top of the page and worked down.
	d) Styled the page for responsiveness for both desktops and mobile phoes with(375px)
	e) Configured and published my repositiry in github.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
While undertaking this project i learned several new things in CSS which includes:
	a) Flexbox and flex: The different properties used while using flexbox layout,
		like flexbox directions, justify items among others.
	b)Creating a toggle menu while screen size reduces using html and css only without using javascript.
	c) Use of media screen with different widths especially with images.
	d) Styling HTML elements using the justify-content and align items



### Continued development
In the coming days i will be focusing on creating animations using css which has been a little chalenging to me 
and i am planning to perfect my skills on that area
